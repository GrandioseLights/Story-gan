In the common parlance, randomness is the apparent lack of pattern or predictability in events. A random sequence of events, symbols or steps often has no order and does not follow an intelligible pattern or combination. Individual random events are by definition unpredictable, but since they often follow a probability distribution, the frequency of different outcomes over numerous events (or "trials") is predictable. For example, when throwing two dice, the outcome of any particular roll is unpredictable, but a sum of 7 will occur twice as often as 4. In this view, randomness is a measure of uncertainty of an outcome, rather than its haphazardness, and applies to concepts of chance, probability, and information entropy.

Water, known to be the universal solvent, plays a key role in the survival of various forms of life on earth. It is used for various purposes such as drinking, cleaning, cooking, washing and bathing. Besides these domestic uses, major amount of water is used in the agricultural sector mainly for the purpose of irrigation. A substantial amount of this substance is also used in the industrial sector.

However, unfortunately despite being aware about the importance of water in our lives, people around the world are leaving no stone unturned in wasting water and deteriorating its quality. The techniques used for irrigation in many parts of the world including India are old and mundane and often cause immense loss of water. Several industries make use of a good amount of water however they end up throwing their waste in water bodies without realizing that the deterioration of water will ultimately lead to their own loss.

Many areas around the world are facing water deficit and many more are likely to face this problem in the times to come. It is time the government must take effective measures to store and save water and channelize it properly for appropriate distribution. The general public must also be sensitized on efficient use of water.
