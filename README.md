# Story-gan
An experiment in which you supply a code some text, and it will spit out it's own original text.

Place training data in the `data.txt` file. Training data can be anything that you want in the for of text.

Some training data has been placed in the `data.txt` file already, I recomend adding more for increased unique and original results.

To run the program, run `Story Gan.py`.
